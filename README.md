# Credit-Card-Approval-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
This is project which the decision tree algorithm analyzes on the data set and decides whether the particular user can be provided  a credit card keeping in mind all the pending dues the customer has

### Mainly after doing the data preprocessing step we will be using `SMOTE` which is used to balance the imbalances in the data and we are using the DecisionTreeClassifier() algorithm used to give us the analysis.
## Foe evaluation we are using the normal evaluation metrics and confusion matrix.
